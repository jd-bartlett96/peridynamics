# Peridynamics

Welcome to the peridynamics research repository of [John Bartlett](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-bartlett-296a44126/) (PhD Candidate, University of Washington)

[Peridynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peridynamics) is a nonlocal integral formulation of continuum mechanics. The research shared here focusses on parallelized implementations of the peridynamic method utilizing GPUs.

The implementation of the peridynamic method present in this work is shared in the 'core' folder. The method descirbed by Algorithm 1 of this work is the 'baseline.py' script. A few optimizations improving the performance of this implementation are included in the accompanying files.
